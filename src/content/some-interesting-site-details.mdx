# Smooth corners with CSS mask-border images

Here's a side by side comparison of the effect I'm taking about:

![comparison between smooth and normally rounded corners](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1170cfc9-14b9-4742-abe7-14d3bd2043bf)

It's a subtle effect but it does look a lot better to me. Unforunately this is only supported on Chromium and WebKit at the time of writing.

The code looks something like this

```css
@utility smooth-md {
  -webkit-mask-box-image-width: 60px;
  mask-border-width: 60px;
  mask-border: url(data:image/png;...);
  -webkit-mask-box-image: url(data:image/png;...);
}
```

They should just add this to css already.

# The Link Component

```astro
<Link href="https://..." external>text</Link>
```

The link component is just a standard wrapper around the `<a>` tag, and adds a nice little arrow when it's external.

The fun part is when I have to replace all the instances of `<a>` with the proper `<Link>` component when rendering the markdown. So I wrote a slightly cursed plugin to do so.

```js
export default function linkToComponent() {
  return (tree) => {
    if (
      !tree.children.some(
        (el) => el.value?.includes("import Link from '@/components/common/Link.astro'") && el.type === 'mdxjsEsm',
      )
    ) {
      tree.children.unshift({
        type: 'mdxjsEsm',
        value: "import Link from '@/components/common/Link.astro';",
        data: { ... },
      });
    }
    for (const child of tree.children) { recursiveWalk(child); }
    return tree;
  };
}

function recursiveWalk(element) {
  if (element.type === 'element' && element.tagName === 'a') {
    const href = element.properties.href;
    const isExternal = !href.startsWith('/');

    element.type = 'mdxJsxFlowElement';
    element. ... = ...; // etc
    if (isExternal) {
      element.attributes.push({
        type: 'mdxJsxAttribute',
        name: 'external',
        value: null,
      });
    }
  } else if (element.children) {
    for (const child of element.children) {
      recursiveWalk(child);
    }
  }
}
```

This walks the AST parsed from rehype(?) and replaces all `<a>` tags with the `<Link>` component. It also adds the `external` prop if the link is external. The plugin is a bit of a mess, but it works for now. I also had to shove in the import statement for the link component in its AST form.

# Fade by element

The last other plugin I use is for the animation delay on each element in the blog. I use a simple fade in animation, and I wanted to stagger the animation for each element. So I wrote a plugin that edits the style for each element in the tree.

```js
export default function rehypeAnimationDelay() {
  return (tree) => {
    let index = 1;
    tree.children.forEach((child) => {
      if (child.type === 'element') {
        const delay = Math.min(20 * 50, index * 50);
        if (child.properties) {
          child.properties.style = `${child.properties?.style || ''}animation-delay: ${delay}ms;`;
          index += 1;
        }
      }
    });
    return tree;
  };
}
```

To be honest, I don't love writing specific plugins like this, not only is it in JavaScript(so untyped), but it also feels like it could break easily.

# The contact me section

I have an api hosted on vercel that spins up a discord bot to send a message with the contents. It was shockingly simple to do. The api is also written in rust, which I didn't think you could host on vercel.
